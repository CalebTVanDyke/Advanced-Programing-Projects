What does curses / ncurses do?

C library with functions to:

	* move cursor
	* grab keystrokes
	* produce colors 
	* create (logical) windows

within a terminal

	-> gives us TUI applications

Basic stuff:

	initscr() - init window
	printw() - print to a window
	getch() - grab a key stroke
	refresh() - refreshes display of the buffer stream
	endwin() - tear down window

Moving cursor around:
	
	x - column number
	y - row number

	getmaxyx(stdscr, rows, cols);

	stores #rows in variable rows
	stores #cols in variable cols

	IT IS A MACRO so you don't need to have ampersands 

	(rows - 1, cols-1) is bottom right corner

	move(y, x); /* This cursor to the position y, x

	mvprintw(y, x, "same as printw here"); /* this moves the cursor and prints also */

	addch(char c);
		/* prints character and advances the character by one */

	mvaddch(y, x, c);

Keystroke stuff:

	int getch();

	^ because we want to grab things like "pg up" or "up arrow"

	echo(); - show keystrokes to screen
	noecho(); - don't

	cbreak(); - keystrokes immediately available
	nocbreak; - keystrokes may be buffered

	keypad(window, int enabled)
		if enabled, keypad escape sequences (e.g.. for up arrow) are converted to useful values

		compare against things like:

			KEY_F(2)
			KEY_LEFT
			KEY_UP
			KEY_DOWN

Reverse video text-

(HIGHLIGHT)

	attron(A_REVERSE);

	From now on, everything you "printw" or "addch"
	will appear in reverse video

	attroff(A_REVERSE);
