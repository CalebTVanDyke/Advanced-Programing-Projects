Command Line Arguments
----------------------

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	/*
		argc - tells you how many arguments are on the command line

		argv - array of (array of characters)


	*/
}

struct date {
	
	int x;
	int y;

}

Terminology:
	- data - is a structure tag
	- structure tags are optional
	- you can put variable declarations after the '}' and before the ';'

Size Of Structs:

	Different types (float, long, short, char) have different alignment requurements

	These are system dependent

	e.g.. "32-bit integers must be aligned on 4 bytes boundaries"

	so they can only be placed in locations where address is devisible by 4

	group types together in structss
