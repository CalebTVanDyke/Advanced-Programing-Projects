C++ - The Beginning
-------------------

Invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in early 1980's

	- wanted OOL that was fast
	- none existed, so he made one

Philosophy of C++

	- retain as much of C as possible

		including efficiency - don't pay for unused features
		including "The programmer is always right"
		many C programs are also C++ programs

			(More reserved words in C++)

	- better type checking

		some things in C must be explicitly cast now

	- clean up some syntax

	- and some features to make programming easier

		references
		classes - basically, structs with methods inside
		templates
		exceptions - just like java
		namespaces
		overloading (function/operators)
		OO-style I/O

	- you can use as few or as many of these features as you like

But:
	
	K&R book: 272 pages

	Stroustrup book: 1020 pages

Nice things we get in C++:

	(1) bool types, and constants 'true' 'false'

		sizeof(1 bytes);

	(2) single - line comments

		// bout damn time

	(3) define variables in a for loop

	(5) struct fun

			strunct foo{			
			};

			struct foo x; // c way
			foo x; // c++ way
