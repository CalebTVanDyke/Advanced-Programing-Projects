Proj1
=====
Project one was our first project and it was in the C language.  For this project we were asked to write a program that can convert a AIFF sound file into a custom sound file format defined by our professor the program should also be able to convert from the custom format to AIFF format.  We also made a program to edit this files from the command line, concatenate to sounds files of either type, cut the sound file up and specific samples, and display info about the sound file.

Proj2
=====
Project to was our second project and it was in C++.  We use QT to create Conway's Game of Life.  In the GUI you should be able to advance stages of the game and just run the game and see every stage.  We also had to read in a custom file defined by our professor to initialize the game to its starting state.  We also made different versions such as Wire World.
